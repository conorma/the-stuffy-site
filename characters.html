            <p>Here you can learn all about the different stuffies!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>KLAUS STUFFIE is the grandfather of many stuffies and the mayor of Stuffietopia. He is a Polar bear
                    stuffie and is 193 years old! </li>
                <li>FRANKY STUFFIE is Klaus' younger brother. He is a 190-year old dog stuffie and is addicted to candy.
                    He eats so much candy that it's a wonder he doesn't get diabetes! </li>
                <li>CHRISTOPHER STUFFIE is Klaus' oldest grandchild. He is a 16-year old brown bear stuffie, and is
                    extremely strong, athletic and has a passion for mini golf and adventures. </li>
                <li>SALLY STUFFIE is one of Klaus' favorite grandchildren and Christopher's cousin. She is a 15-year old
                    seal stuffie who loves swimming and doing things with her grandfather.</li>
                <li>MOUSEY STUFFIE is one of Klaus' grandchildren and is 15 years old-just like Sally. Mousey is a mouse
                    stuffie with a weakness for cheese. He loves skateboarding and is always ready to try new things. He
                    has a nemesis named Blousey and disappears whenever Blousey is near.</li>
                <li>BABY PANDA STUFFIE, also known as B.P., loves boxing, wrestling, and karate. He also enjoys playing
                    sports, eating, rock climbing, and biking. This 16-year old grandson of Klaus is a panda stuffie who
                    is remarkably large for his age.</li>
                <li>BEEP BEEP STUFFIE is Christopher's 14-year old younger brother who happens to be an unusual shade of
                    gold. He is a brown bear stuffie, so it's a bit strange that he's golden. He may be only 14 years
                    old, but he has accomplished many things, such as climbing Mount Beden.This bear loves
                    skateboarding, sports, and video games. He is the youngest of his family and also happens to be a
                    billonare. Most of that money comes from his grandfather, Klaus who is a very rich bear. Beep beep
                    is also a computer whiz.</li>
                <li>POOH STUFFIE is Christopher's younger brother and Beep beep's older brother who loves playing the
                    saxaphone and cleaning up after everyone. He is a 15-year old brown bear stuffie and is yellow.
                    (Strange, right?!) For some strange reason, he looks a lot like Winnie-the-Pooh.</li>
                <li>DINO STUFFIE, (pronounced DEE-NO) is Sally's friend (and cousin!) who loves building and has
                    dreams to be a docter. She is a 15-year old T-rex dino who has two younger brothers. Dino loves
                    wrestling her brothers, playing shawrock, (a game when you throw teeth at rocks) racing, and playing
                    board games.</li>
                <li>FLUFFKIN STUFFIE is Dino's 14-year old younger brother and loves following his sister, playing with
                    his cousins, and generally asking his sister to give him checkups at inappropriate times.</li>
                <li>BLOUSEY is Mousey's nemesis and an evil mouse stuffie. He has only two legs and is missing one eye.
                    He was actually teleported from Dimension 8324716059EVL^^/DPLCT*@# during one of Klaus' experiments
                    and the cousins are trying to foil all his evil plans and send him back to his normal dimension.
                </li>
                <li>DR. BEAR STUFFIE is Christopher's, Pooh's and Beep beep's 30-year old father. He has a medical
                    degree, henceforth the name Dr. Bear. He loves safety, and is quick to ground his sons after they
                    return from dangerous missions. His wife is trying to stop that!</li>
                <li>MUFFINS STUFFIE is the elder brother of his "pack", (which he likes to call "The Biggest Puppie Pack
                    Ever", even though it only consists of him and his brother, who is only slightly younger than he is)
                    and loves science, experiments, and explosions. He may only be 15 years old, but he LOVES using
                    large, confusing, words.</li>
                <li>BROWNIE is Muffin's biggest enemy. Technically, he's only a big bully and has been since Muffins won
                    first place in a science competition, while he was in twentieth place. After that, he's thought that
                    Muffins is the biggest cheater in the history of the universe, and has been extremelly mean to
                    Muffins ever since. (Don't tell anyone, but the only reason Brownie lost is because he doesn't know
                    anything about science!) For some reason, Brownie seems to be the complete opposite of Muffins!
                    Don't ask ME why, though.</li>
                <li>FLUFFY STUFFIE is Muffins' 15-year old younger brother who likes pretty much everything that Muffins
                    likes, as long as it's not an enormous explosion. He loves blueberries and isn't afraid to stand up
                    to bullies, such as Brownie. He has one bent ear which makes him slightly deaf.</li>
                <li>KIPPER is a 14-year old TY kangaroo stuffie who has just realized that Klaus is his grandfather. He
                    loves going on
                    adventures with his brothers and jumping on trampolines. (Without his brothers.)</li>

                    loves going on
                    adventures with his brothers and jumping on trampolines. (Without his brothers.) P.S. They're
                    triplets.</li>
                <li>ELECTRO is a 14-year old Tsum Tsum with weapons and an attitude. Strangely, she seems to think
                    Donald's cute. Why is that strange? Because she doesn't think many stuffies are cute!
                    On the other hand, Donald doesn't seem to think Electro's cute at all!</li>
                <li>LAMBY STUFFIE is Franky's wife and a friendly 188 lamb. She is great at gardening and loves
                    planting...plants. Or trees. It depends on how she's feeling that day. She also makes delicious
                    vegan mac n' cheese, fried chicken, and shepherd's pie. She puts delicious lamb in her shepherd's
                    pie to make it taste even better. Wait, lamb? Uh-oh...</li>
