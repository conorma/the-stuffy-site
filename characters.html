            <p>Here you can learn all about the different stuffies!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>KLAUS STUFFIE is the grandfather of many stuffies and the mayor of Stuffietopia. He is a Polar bear
                    stuffie and is 193 years old! </li>
                <li>FRANKY STUFFIE is Klaus' younger brother. He is a 190-year old dog stuffie and is addicted to candy.
                    He eats so much candy that it's a wonder he doesn't get diabetes! </li>
                <li>CHRISTOPHER STUFFIE is Klaus' oldest grandchild. He is a 16-year old brown bear stuffie, and is
                    extremely strong, athletic and has a passion for mini golf and adventures. </li>
                <li>SALLY STUFFIE is one of Klaus' favorite grandchildren and Christopher's cousin. She is a 15-year old
                    seal stuffie who loves swimming and doing things with her grandfather.</li>
                <li>MOUSEY STUFFIE is one of Klaus'grandchildren and is 15 years old-just like Sally. Mousey is a mouse
                    stuffie with a weakness for cheese. He loves skateboarding and is always ready to try new things. He
                    has a nemesis named Blousey and disappears whenever Blousey is near.</li>
                <li>BABY PANDA STUFFIE, also known as B.P., loves boxing, wrestling, and karate. He also enjoys playing
                    sports, eating, rock climbing, and biking. This 16-year old grandson of Klaus is a panda stuffie who
                    is remarkably large for his age.</li>
